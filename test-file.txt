you’re damned if you do and you’re damned if you don’t
stay safe stay well stay happy
so many places so little time
i wish i may; i wish i might
ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country

fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me
run far run fast
monkey see monkey do
open heart open mind
great haste makes great waste
